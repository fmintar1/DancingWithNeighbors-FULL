## Passion Project: Dancing With Neighbors

One of my hobbies in my spare time is to dance, mainly Salsa & Bachata.
However, the issue with this style of dance is, it requires partner.
Often times, if you know others who enjoy dancing the same style as you do, you just hit them up, and schedule a time.
But what if they’re busy? It’s not easy to practice alone.

This is why I am passionate to create an app called **Dancing With Neighbors**.
In this app, you make your own personal profile, such as:
  - Profile picture,
  - Name,
  - Birthdate,
  - Area of location,
  - Main dancing style,
  - Availability

After you complete your profile, you now can get connected with others!
You can search for others who are around your area, maybe have the same dance styles as yours, that matches your schedule,
and you can ask them if they’re available to practice. Easy as pie.

So, dancers, or anyone who’s interested in dancing but required partner(s), just use Dancing With Neighbors app, and create a community of dancers!
